  <h1>Privacy Policy for Salesforce QuickField</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 16, 2025 </p>

  <p><strong>Salesforce QuickField</strong> is a Chrome extension that helps Salesforce administrators quickly create custom fields and assign field-level security (FLS) to profiles. We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining transparency about how data is handled.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or sell personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data.</p>
  <p>To perform its core functionality, the extension sends field creation metadata (e.g., field labels, API names, and permissions) to a secure backend service hosted on Render. This communication is used solely to process field creation and return metadata configurations. No session IDs, passwords, or PII are stored or shared.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To access the current Salesforce tab for context-aware operations.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting:</strong> To inject scripts into the Salesforce UI to read metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>clipboardWrite:</strong> To allow users to copy their session ID when they choose to share temporary access.</li>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> To remember user preferences and field configuration settings locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions:</strong> (<code>https://*.salesforce.com/</code>) To operate only within the Salesforce domain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Transmission to Backend</h2>
  <p>The extension communicates with a Node.js backend hosted on Render to generate Salesforce field metadata. Only non-personal configuration data is transmitted. This data is not stored or shared with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-party Access</h2>
  <p>Salesforce QuickField does not use third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising. The only external service accessed is the backend API used for field generation.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes</h2>
  <p>Any future changes to this policy will be posted here. Continued use of the extension indicates acceptance of any updates.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <strong>mohammadfaiz9760@gmail.com</strong></p>
